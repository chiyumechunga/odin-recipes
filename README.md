# odin-recipes

Odin recipes is a hands-on project that trains aspiring web developers the skills needed to thrive in the field.
The project is based on creating an HTML file describing any recipe.
So I chose the Nshima recipe which is my staple food in my motherland - Zambia.

The skills to be performed are as follows:

1. Creating a new repository for the project on Github.com
2. Cloning the repository to my workstation using git.
3. Compounding the git commands and putting them to use.
4. Maneuvering the terminal to the project directory.
5. Populating the README.md file.
6. Creating an index.html file within the odin-recipes directory.
7. Populating the index.html file with the appropriate syntax.
